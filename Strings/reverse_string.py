Reverse string

Reverse string, in linear time complexity.

Input: 'i like this program very much'
Output: 'hcum yrev margorp siht ekil i'

Input: 'how are you'
Output: 'uoy era woh'

=========================================
Reverse the whole sentence by swapping pair letters in-place (first with last, second with second from the end, etc).
In Python, the string manipulation operations are too slow (string is immutable), because of that we need to convert the string into array.
In C/C++, the Space complexity will be O(1).
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(N)

def reverse_sentence(sentence):
    arr = list(sentence)
    start = 0
    end = len(arr) - 1

    while start < end:
        # reverse the array from the start index to the end index by
        # swaping each char with the pair from the other part of the array
        swap(arr, start, end)
        start += 1
        end -= 1

    return ''.join(arr)

def swap(arr, i, j):
    # swapping two elements from a same array
    temp = arr[i]
    arr[i] = arr[j]
    arr[j] = temp
